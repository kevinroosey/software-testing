# Software Testing Roadmap

## 1. Software Requirement Characteristics
Defines the qualities required in software requirements, such as completeness, consistency, and verifiability, to ensure effective testing and development.

## 2. Testing Categories
An overview of various types of testing approaches and their importance in ensuring software quality.

### 2.1 White Box Testing
Testing based on internal code structure. Common techniques include code coverage, path testing, and statement testing.

### 2.2 Black Box Testing
Testing without knowledge of internal code, focusing on inputs and expected outputs.

### 2.3 Grey Box Testing
A blend of black-box and white-box testing, where the tester has limited knowledge of the system's internals.

### 2.4 Static & Dynamic Testing
Static testing involves code reviews, inspections, and walkthroughs without executing the code. Dynamic testing involves running the code to find defects.

### 2.5 Positive & Negative Testing
- **Positive Testing**: Validates that the software works as expected with valid input.
- **Negative Testing**: Ensures software handles invalid or unexpected inputs gracefully.

## 3. Testing Axioms
A set of principles and guidelines that underlie effective software testing.

## 4. Testing Techniques
Methods used to design and select test cases.

### 4.1 Equivalence Partitioning
Divides input data into partitions that are expected to behave similarly, reducing the number of test cases needed.

### 4.2 Boundary Value Analysis
Focuses on testing the boundaries between partitions.

### 4.3 Risk-Based Testing
Prioritizes testing based on risk assessment, focusing on areas with higher potential impact or likelihood of failure.

### 4.4 Inside-Out
Testing starts with lower-level components and gradually integrates outward.

### 4.5 Outside-In
Begins testing from the user interface and progresses to deeper integration with other components.

### 4.6 State-based Testing
Tests the software's response to different state changes to ensure accurate behavior across transitions.

### 4.7 All-Pairs Testing
Tests every combination of input parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage with fewer test cases.

### 4.8 Decision Tree/Table Testing
Decision tables outline different input combinations and their corresponding expected outputs.

### 4.9 Code Inspections
A review process where code is examined for errors or issues before testing.

### 4.10 Automated Testing
Using tools to automate test execution, helping improve efficiency and consistency in repetitive test cases.

## 5. Testing Types
Types of tests used in various stages of the software development lifecycle.

### 5.1 Acceptance Testing
Ensures the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.

### 5.2 API Testing
Validates the interaction and functionality of APIs.

### 5.3 Beta Testing
Software is tested by end-users in a real-world environment before final release.

### 5.4 Compatibility Testing
Checks that the software works as expected across different devices, operating systems, and browsers.

### 5.5 Functional/System Testing
Tests the complete functionality of the system against requirements.

### 5.6 Integration Testing
Tests interactions between integrated components or systems to verify compatibility.

### 5.7 Performance Testing
Evaluates software performance under load, including response time and resource usage.

### 5.8 Load Testing
Simulates a large number of users to ensure the system can handle expected traffic.

### 5.9 Stress Testing
Tests the system under extreme conditions to evaluate stability and error handling.

### 5.10 Regression Testing
Re-tests software after changes to ensure no new issues have been introduced.

### 5.11 Security Testing
Validates the softwareâ€™s security measures, identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

### 5.12 Unit Testing
Tests individual units or components of code for correct behavior.

### 5.13 Usability Testing
Evaluates how easy and efficient it is for users to interact with the software.

### 5.14 Accessibility Testing
Ensures the software is accessible to people with disabilities.

## 6. Test Case Contents
Defines the structure and information that should be included in test cases, such as preconditions, inputs, expected results, and postconditions.

## 7. Estimation Techniques
Methods used to estimate the time, effort, and resources needed for testing.

## 8. JUnit Unit Testing
A unit testing framework for Java, used to automate testing of individual components.

## 9. Crowdsourced Testing
Uses a distributed group of testers to perform tests, often for usability and compatibility in various environments.

## 10. Software Bugs & Bug Tracking
Tracking and managing bugs identified during testing, using tools to document and prioritize defects.

## 11. Testing Mobile Applications
Approaches for testing mobile apps, covering aspects like usability, compatibility, and performance on mobile devices.

## 12. Test Execution Results Reporting
Documentation of test results, including summaries of passed/failed tests, defects found, and overall test coverage.
