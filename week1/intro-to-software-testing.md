# Intro to Software Testing

## What is software testing

	* Validation
	* Verification

## Software specs and testing

### Hierarchy of software specs contain three or more levels of spec docs

* Requirements specs
* Architectural design spec
* Detailed design specs

It is possible to test software at various stages

* Unit testing, where each unit is tested to verify
* Software integration testing, where progressively larger groups of software components are tested
* System testing, in which software is integrated to the overall product 

The following list provides some rules to follow:

Always test against a specification. If tests are not developed from a specification, then it is not
testing. Hence, testing is totally reliant upon adequate specification of software.
• Document the testing process: specify tests and record test results.
• Test hierarchically against each level of specification. Finding more errors earlier will ultimately reduce
costs.
• Plan verification and validation activities, particularly testing.
• Complement testing with techniques such as static analysis and dynamic analysis.
• Always test positively: that the software does what it should, but also negatively: that it doesn't do
what it shouldn't.
• Have the right attitude to testing - it should be a challenge, not the chore it so often becomes.
